# There are five startup files that zsh will read commands from:
# 
# $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
# $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
# $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
# $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
# $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
# If ZDOTDIR is not set, then the value of HOME is used; this is the usual case.
# 
# `.zshenv' is sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the -f option is set. It should contain commands to set the command search path, plus other important environment variables. `.zshenv' should not contain commands that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
# 
# `.zshrc' is sourced in interactive shells. It should contain commands to set up aliases, functions, options, key bindings, etc.
# 
# `.zlogin' is sourced in login shells. It should contain commands that should be executed only in login shells. `.zlogout' is sourced when login shells exit. `.zprofile' is similar to `.zlogin', except that it is sourced before `.zshrc'. `.zprofile' is meant as an alternative to `.zlogin' for ksh fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired. `.zlogin' is not the place for alias definitions, options, environment variable settings, etc.; as a general rule, it should not change the shell environment at all. Rather, it should be used to set the terminal type and run a series of external commands (fortune, msgs, etc).
