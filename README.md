## Testing Neovim Configs
Probably one of the only degens to setup testing for their neovim config in CI ðŸ˜‚.

As of now you can take a look at the following code snippets on how this works.

- [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) that uses `node:trixie-slim` as the base image
- [`hack cli`](/packages/hack/src/cli.ts) for building the docker image and testing it
- [main docker entry script](/test-nvim.sh) with all the magic sauce
- How you can [avoid pagers in neovim](https://github.com/Hacksore/dotfiles/blob/a808133b4d34f1b26097398612b1fe881829152c/.config/nvim/lua/hacksore/lazy.lua#L1-L3)
- [Running this in github action CI](/.github/workflows/nvim-ci.yaml)

Testing locally is as easy as `pnpm test` and it will build the docker image and run the test command.
