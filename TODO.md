# Fix these for nvim
- format on save in typescript files (caused by pack?)
- files the have strange amounts of JSX will break prettier formatting
- control+o/i should reopen a closed buffer
- using `ctrl+f` should work in neotree
- big json files still halt the editor
- fix the wonky formatting with angle braces in JSX/TSX files
  - strangely when auto format happens it's fine it's just <Leader>lf
